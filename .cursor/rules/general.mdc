- No TODOs or placeholder comments. If something is deferred, do not leave a tag—create an issue in the tracker.
- Code must be concise, refactored, and componentized. Duplicate logic is extracted to shared packages.
- All portals reference the Brand Guide (branding.mdc) and the shared packages/styles tokens.
- GitHub Actions blocks merges if lint, types, unit, integration, and Playwright don’t pass.
- Secrets/config come from environment (AWS SSM/Secrets Manager). Never hardcode.
- Use Context7 MCP to get latest documentation.
- Do not write excessive documentation. Documentation should be treated as guides for developers to use major features.
- Use the docs folder in root to consolidate documentation instead of putting it into root. Organize according to folders.
- Update documentation in existing files wherever possible. Let's keep documentation concise.
