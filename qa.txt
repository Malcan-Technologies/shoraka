SECTION: ADMIN PRODUCTS
[x] Admin can create products. 
  - if documents are uploaded. make sure it only save to s3 after user click save and continue)
  - saved under products/<db_id>/<here>
[x] Products are listed in the admin section.
  - appear from latest to oldest

// multple page
  - should work if the list span to multiple pages
[x] Products have specific versions.
  - always start at v1
[x] Product version increases when an admin changes a product.
  - make sure image store in s3, is not based on this product version (it should be based on version name that is stored in the s3_key)
  - when update an image the version of the image should update, date stay as when the s3_key is created (prefer)
[x] Products control which application steps are shown
  - in the admin products page, when click edit on the product it should have a modal that shows u the workflow steps

// multiple page
  - should still have the modal when use click on the next page of the table
[x] Products appear on the Issuer's Financing Type page.
  - appear latest first to oldest
[x] Admin can search for products by name.
// multiple page
  - should work if ther is more than 10
  - clear filter should work
[x] Admin can use pagination to view product lists.
[x] Admin can delete products.
  - when delete a product, check in s3 that the products/<db_id> is deleted which will includes all the s3_key that are associate with this path
  - check in the db if the product is deleted 

[] Every CRUD should be recorded in product logs table
  - the metadata should store the exact worfklow and version from that specific crud action. (eg. current is {step: 1}, when i update it become {step: 2} i should store {step: 2}  with status PRODUCT_UPDATED)
  - for delete store the last recorded worfklow and version before it is deleted with status PRODUCT_DELETED
  - when create, teh metadata is storign the info to create that thing with status PRODUCT_CREATED

  - product logs table, latest should appear first ( every admin crud should all appear under one table) !!!! not tested

- when storing document to s3, version_date_cuid.ext, the date is stored in utc time 8 hours less than current malaysia time

- copany details save and continue button should gray out when a field is not seta
 -company detials when click save will always trigger as got changes

 - version mismatch error when switch differnt product with differnt version when save and continue will still prompt it shouldnt, need ot add a check only do that test if product id is the same

QUESTIONS
- under business details has a field called is same invoice beingused, will there be any validation for this field?
- bank details, in bank account numbers should it be store as number or stirng? current is string in db (ic also for contact person)

FEATURE to add
